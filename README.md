# DotA 2 AI Competition Framework
The purpose of this framework is to provide a platform for AI competitions in DotA 2. It handles AI setup as well as wrapping the regular DotA 2 lua API to prevent AI scripts from accessing data or performing actions, to emulate the AI playing as a human player.

### Goals of the framework:
+ Encourage the development of Lua AI for dota custom games.
+ Provide a starting point for developers that want AI in their games.
+ Eventually having decent AI for bot matches.

## Challenges
Different challenges will drive development in different directions. Therefore the AI framework provides different challenges for AI to deal with. The challenges currently supported are:
* 1v1 Mid - Two AI face off 1v1 mid on identical heroes on the default dota map. The first AI to kill a tower or get two kills on the other AI wins.

Possible future challenges are:
* Farm optimization challenge
* Three versus three mid and jungle.
* 1v1v1v1
* Last hit challenge

## Documentation
Framework AI only has access to a limited subset of the regular dota 2 lua AI. The available functions can be found here:
* [Global functions](https://github.com/ModDota/Dota2AIFramework/wiki/Global-AI-API)
* [Unit functions](https://github.com/ModDota/Dota2AIFramework/wiki/Unit-AI-API)
* [Ability functions](https://github.com/ModDota/Dota2AIFramework/wiki/Ability-AI-AI)
* AIEvents
* AIPlayerResource

## Using framework AI in a custom game
To use AI from this framework in a custom game, simply copy the entire scripts/vscripts/AI/ directory, then require AIManager in your gamemode. An existing AI can then be attached to an existing unit using:
```lua
AIManager:AttachAI( 'ai_name', unit )
```
This will load the AI named ai_name from AI/UserAI/ai_name and attach it to unit.
